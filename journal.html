            <p>Today I completed my first lab which I found pretty fun.</p>
            <p>The only section I found confusing was the passwords as I was unable to get to add another password file other than the first one.</p>
            <p>I learned many things from this lab such as using FTP clients and using the McMaster SSH server!</p>
            <p>Although for the coding side, since I already knew html and css I didn't learn much, but that's okay!</p>
