                        <p>Today I completed my first lab which I found pretty fun.</p>
                        <p>The only section I found confusing was the passwords as I was unable to get to add another
                            password file other than the first one.</p>
                        <p>I learned many things from this lab such as using FTP clients and using the McMaster SSH
                            server!</p>
                        <p>Although for the coding side, since I already knew html and css I didn't learn much, but
                            that's
                            okay!<br><br></p>

                        <li><strong>January 22, 2025:</strong></li>
                        <p>Although I couldn't attend the lab in person, I did the lab online.</p>
                        <p>I found this lab pretty interesting as I learned how to make my website reactive to different
                            sizes.</p>
                        <p>Although I only added 2 different sizes, it works pretty well as I scale around my website,
                            so I think it's okay for now.</p>
                        <p>I believe my website is better now, but I still think there is room for improvement, and plan
                            on working on my website some more later on.<br><br></p>

                        <p>My experiences with JavaScript so far have been pretty interesting as I find that much of
                            Javascript is simular to what I have already done</p>
                        <p>Since I have already coded some javascript before and have used languages like Python, C# and
                            C, learning Javascript was fairly easy!</p>
                        <p>Although one new thing I learned that I found interesting was using the input types in HTML
                            and coding them in Javascript to create these intereactable input types that work very well
                            on the front-end!</p>
                        <p>Overall I'm excited to see what new concepts and lanugages we will learn in this course in
                            future!<br><br></p>
