                        <p>Today I completed my first lab which I found pretty fun.</p>
                        <p>The only section I found confusing was the passwords as I was unable to get to add another
                            password file other than the first one.</p>
                        <p>I learned many things from this lab such as using FTP clients and using the McMaster SSH server!</p>
                        <p>Although for the coding side, since I already knew html and css I didn't learn much, but that's
                            okay!</p>

                        <p>Although I couldn't attend the lab in person, I did the lab online.</p>
                        <p>I found this lab pretty interesting as I learned how to make my website reactive to different sizes.</p>
                        <p>Although I only added 2 different sizes, it works pretty well as I scale around my website, so I think it's okay for now.</p>
                        <p>I believe my website is better now, but I still think there is room for improvement, and plan on working on my website some more later on.</p>
